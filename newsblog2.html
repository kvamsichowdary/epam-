            <p>Chennai Super Kings on Friday posted a video on its Instagram account which was edited in such a way that made it look like their talisman Mahendra Singh Dhoni was bowling to himself in the nets.

                The video titled “The Multiverse of Mahi” has rare visuals of MS Dhoni rolling his arms as well as batting in the nets.

                Mutual funds to secure a monthly income of Rs 40,000
            </h2>

                It seems you are new to investing in mutual funds. When you are planning for retirement, there are two phases: accumulation phase and retirement phase. In the accumulation phase, you save and invest to create a corpus. In the retirement phase you start taking money out by drawing a regular income. The strategy is different in both the phases. For example, most investors, especially young investors, would invest aggressively in equities to build a large retirement corpus in the accumulation phase. Once they retire or a few years before retirement, they will shift the investments in equities to safer avenues like debt mutual funds and bank deposits to draw a regular income. Unless you plan your retirement systematically, you will run out of money soon. That is why one has to be realistic when investing for retirement.
